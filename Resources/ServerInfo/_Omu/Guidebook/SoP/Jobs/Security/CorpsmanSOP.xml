  # Corpsman SOP
  This is the list of procedures, responsibilities, and duties of the [color=#ba292c][bold]Corpsman[/bold][/color] of this station.

  <ColorBox>
    <Box>
      For the purposes of Alert Escalation: Treat higher alerts as if they are still on the previous alert level. (Yellow Alert is Blue Alert if it was Blue Alert prior.) Furthermore, treat Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, and Violet Alert as Red Alert.

  ## Green Alert
  1. The Corpsman must provide emergency medical care to prisoners, and most importantly, Security personnel. The Corpsman should always prioritise brig. Failure to do so is grounds for HOS or Warden to terminate the Corpsman's contract. 

  2. The Corpsman may conduct arrests, searches or any other Security procedures, however their number 1 priority is keeping security and prisoners health in check.

  3. The Corpsman may leave security at will, however they should prioritise the [color=#ba292c][bold]Warden's[/bold][/color] or [color=#ba292c][bold]Head Of Security's[/bold][/color] wishes if there's ever a conflict of interest. If a reasonable request is denied or ignored, their contract may be terminated.
  <Box>Exception is made if a Security member is down and requires rescue, or if they must visit the Medical department to replenish supplies.</Box>

  4. The Corpsman may carry any security equipment, while respecting alert levels, without compromising their duties as a Corpsman.

  ## Blue Alert
  1. Guidelines 1 and 2 are carried over from [color=#388c34]Green Alert[/color].

  ## Red Alert
  1. Guideline 1 is carried over from [color=#388c34]Green Alert[/color].

  2. The Corpsman is given the same authority and rights as Security Officers with the [color=#ba292c][bold]Head of Security's[/bold][/color] approval, but they should still prioritize healing.
